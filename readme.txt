There are following extended functions of my project:

1.When users fail to create a meeting, the programme will report what the error is, which is mainly implemented by exception class.

2.The programme does not always list all the orders.When users need helps, they can press "[Ctrl] + Z".

3.Users can terminate the programme by pressing "[Ctrl] + C" whenever they want and their records will be saved instantly before that.
